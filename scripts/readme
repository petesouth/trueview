Client Configuration


CollectD  

  In /usr/local/etc/collectd.conf

     1) hostname = "my_server_name_whatever_format"
     2)  LoadPlugin Network

          <Plugin Network>
                Server "trueview-demo.freehive.io" "25826"

          </Plugin>

           2a. the more plugins turned on.. The better.  If you can do percent and complex.. Turn them both on.


Telegraf

     1) sudo pkg install telegraf
     2) telegraf config > /usr/local/etc/telegraf.conf
 
In /usr/local/etc/telegraf.conf


      search for host  and set hostname = "my_server_name_whatever_format"      (SAME NAME AS IN COLLECTD HOST NAME)

       Go down to inputs section Turn everything on that you can.
       Search for "outputs.influx"

       Make sure it's not commented out... Make sure the influx server path is..  trueview-demo.freehive.io


Now you can run it all


service collectd start    (or restart)

telegraf -config /usr/local/etc/telegraf.conf & 


That's it.. You should now be able to manually under Settings / Servers... Add a server whose system serial is "my_server_name_whatever_format"  (same as in telegraf/collectd hostname)

Once added.. Push the Register Link...


Your server is now added to trueview.. With all the data.
